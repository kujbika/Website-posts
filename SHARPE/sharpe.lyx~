 Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Markowitz portfolio theory, allocating among tradable assets
 on the market yields to a convex optimization problem.
 That is, by the linearity of expectation and the by far non-linearity of
 variance, one can always diversify his/her portfolio to obtain a unambiguously
 better portfolio, if by better we mean greater expected return whilst same
 volatility level or less volatility while having the same expectation.
 Given a utility function of the trader, the optimization problem is always
 solvable, and of course it is dependent on personal preferences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if there happens to exist a risk-free investment opptunity in the
 market, then the allocation weights among the risky assets do not depend
 on the utility function, which is a breathtaking result.
 We will derive on the following pages, that the optimal choice of portfolio
 is the one, that maximizes the so-called Sharpe-ratio.
 It is a very intuitive metric, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $Sharpe=\frac{E(r_{portfolio})-r_{riskfree}}{\sigma_{portfolio}}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 sign stands for expectation
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which measures a portfolio's performance in terms of its volatility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By adding more and more assets into the picture, we can 
\begin_inset Formula $never$
\end_inset

 decrease the Sharpe-ratio.
 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tells us, that in an ideal world,
 everybody is holding the market portfolio, which consists of all the possible
 trading opportunities in the world with positive weights relative to their
 market capitalization.
 The market portfolio is then maximizing the Sharpe-ratio, and every rational
 trader allocates his/her money between the risk-free opportunity and the
 market portfolio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The note proceeds as follows: first, I would like to clarify what I mentioned
 in the introduction part, then I am going to do some math where I am digging
 deeper into theory.
 I will show, that the Sharpe-ratio is not a metric that was found by 'accident'
, instead it is the market price of risk taken.

 Markowitz portfolio theory - the basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{x}$
\end_inset

 be the vector of tradable assets on the market with return expectations
 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{e}$
\end_inset

, with a covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum,$
\end_inset

 between these returns.
 It is a known fact, that if we assign weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{w}$
\end_inset

 to the assets, then 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w^{T}x)=w^{T}E(x)=w^{T}e$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Var(w^{T}x)=w^{T}\sum w$
\end_inset

.
 The formulas exactly mean that the expectation is a linear operator, not
 like the variance.
 Moreover, the variances are summable if and only if the returns of the
 assets are independent from each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematics here is crucial, as this little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

issue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the variances imply that we can diversify our portfolio, to obtain
 a smaller variance level after the portfolio allocation.
 In the following I assume, that the trader is rational, risk-averse, moreover
 he/she prefers a greater return to a smaller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Fact1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is at least one non-zero correlation between the returns of the
 assets, then it is always optimal to assign weights to at least those two
 assets in the portfolio, that are correlated.
 This strategy strictly dominates the single-asset portfolio, as it can
 yield either the same volatility with greater return, or the same return
 with smaller volatility level, depening on the weights.
 See

 for graphical proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Fact2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By adding an additional asset into the pool, we are surely in a 
\begin_inset Formula $better,\ or\ equal$
\end_inset

 situation than we were previously.
 Indeed, by assigning a zero weight to the new asset, we are right in the
 situation where we were before, so we can reach the same portfolios that
 we could before.
 Hence, if we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 the set of all possible portfolios reachable before adding the new asset,
 and by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 the respective set after the addition, then 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}\subset S_{1}$
\end_inset

.
